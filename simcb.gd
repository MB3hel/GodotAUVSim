# Simulated control board
# Implements the same math and command processing as a real control board would
# but does it using Godot itself.
# This allows some testing without a real control board
#   - Test or validate math implementation or changes
#   - Test the logic of code using control board (motion)
#   - Test code to communicate with the control board (messages and format)
# However there are some limitations (which is why using a real control board 
# is supported at all)
#   - Does not allow testing of math under "real" conditions. Mostly related to
#     timing and CPU load conditions.
#   - Does not allow testing of firmware bugs. Ex: issues in firmware math 
#     libraries, firmware crashes, firmware deadlocks
#
# Note that this implementation is not the most efficient dataflow. The simcb
# is meant to be a "drop in" replacement for a real control board.
# As such, messages are formatted here before they are given to the cboard
# layer. This means the cboard layer technically performs some unnecessary
# parsing. Likewise, the netiface parses a message, the it is written raw
# to simcb only to be parsed again. This is not the most efficient method of
# doing things, however it ensures that cboard is almost identacal for a real
# control board or with simcb. It also means that no simcb logic or data
# data handling need to be in cboard. This makes the simulator more maintainable
# and shouldn't impact simulator performance too much.
