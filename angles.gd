# NOTE: Control board and godot use different euler angle conventions
# Godot uses a "first Y, then X, and Z last" convention (doesn't explicitly 
# state intrinsic vs extrinsic either). Note: This is composition order
#
# Control baord uses intrinsic angles (specifically Taitâ€“Bryan angles) cooresponding to what
# are typically referred to as pitch (attitude), roll (bank), and yaw (heading)
# However, the control board uses a less standard coordinate system (differnt from what is 
# typically used with aircraft these angles are commonly used with). For the control board,
# yaw is about z, roll is about y, and pitch is about x (and positive z is up not down).
# Thus the convention used is z-x'-y'' (yaw around world z, the pitch about object x, finally
# roll around object y). The terms yaw, roll, and pitch refer to the same things though.
# Yaw is the heading of the robot in the world. Pitch is the front of the robot raising or lowering
# and roll is a banking motion about the pitched (and yawed) y axis.
#
# When applying rotations to godot objects, the godot convention must be used
# When passing angles to the control board script (and displaying in UIs)
# the control board convention is used
#
# Quaternions are used as a go between
# 
# NOTE THAT ALL EULER ANGLES MUST BE IN RADIANS FOR THESE FUNCTIONS!!!
